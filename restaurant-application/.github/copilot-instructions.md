## Restaurant Management System

This project is a comprehensive restaurant management system built with Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. It includes:

- **Management Features**: Inventory tracking, cost management, employee management, sales tracking
- **Partnership Features**: Profit sharing between partners (40/60 split)
- **Customer Features**: Order management system (to be implemented later)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for robust data management

The system prioritizes management functionality first to track daily operations, costs, and profitability.
