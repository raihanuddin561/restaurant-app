# Modal Responsive Design Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Text Overflow and Wrapping**
- **Before**: Long text in modals could overflow beyond modal boundaries
- **After**: Added proper text wrapping with `break-words`, `hyphens-auto`, and CSS `word-wrap: break-word`

### 2. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- **Before**: Fixed desktop-only sizing
- **After**: Responsive sizing for mobile, tablet, and desktop

### 3. **Modal Container**
- **Before**: Fixed padding and could be too wide on mobile
- **After**: 
  - Mobile: `max-w-[95vw]` with `p-4` padding
  - Desktop: Original max-width with responsive padding
  - Full width on mobile, controlled max-width on larger screens

### 4. **Typography Scaling**
- **Before**: Fixed text sizes
- **After**: Responsive text sizes using `text-xs sm:text-sm` pattern

### 5. **Icon Scaling**
- **Before**: Fixed icon sizes
- **After**: Smaller icons on mobile (`w-4 h-4`), larger on desktop (`w-5 h-5` or `w-6 h-6`)

### 6. **Button Layout**
- **Before**: Side-by-side buttons that could be cramped on mobile
- **After**: Stacked buttons on mobile (`flex-col`), side-by-side on desktop (`sm:flex-row`)
- Primary action button appears first on mobile, second on desktop

### 7. **Input Fields**
- **Before**: Fixed sizing
- **After**: Responsive text confirmation inputs with proper mobile sizing

### 8. **Notification Positioning**
- **Before**: Fixed right positioning
- **After**: 
  - Mobile: Full width with left/right margins
  - Desktop: Fixed right positioning
  - Responsive positioning with `left-4 sm:left-auto`

## Technical Improvements

### CSS Classes Added:
- `break-words` - Allows breaking long words
- `hyphens-auto` - Adds hyphens for better word breaking
- `overflowWrap: 'break-word'` - CSS style for aggressive word wrapping
- `max-w-[95vw]` - Responsive viewport-based max width
- `sm:` prefixes for responsive breakpoints
- `flex-col sm:flex-row` - Responsive flex direction
- `order-1 sm:order-2` - Button order changes on different screens

### Components Updated:

2. **Message** - Message component text wrapping
3. **Button** - Responsive button sizing and text truncation
4. **ConfirmationModals** - All confirmation modals button layouts
